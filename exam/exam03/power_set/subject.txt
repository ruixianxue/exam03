Assignment name: power_set1 
Expected files: *.c, *.h  
Allowed functions: write, atoi, printf, malloc, calloc, realloc, free

### Sujet :

write programm that will take as arguments an integer n followed by a set s of integer.
your programm should display all the subsets of s whose sum of elements is n.

in case of a malloc your programm will exit with code 1.

we will not test with invalid sets (for exampl '1 1 2')

hint : the empty set is a subset of any set

for exampl :

$> ./power_set1 3 1 0 2 4 5 3 | cat -e
3$
0 3$
1 2$
1 0 2$

$> ./power_set1 12 5 2 1 8 4 3 7 11 | cat -e
8 4$
1 11$
1 4 7$
1 8 3$
2 3 7$
5 7$
5 4 3$
5 2 1 4$

$> ./power_set1 7 3 8 2 | cat -e
 $> ./power_set1 0 1 -1 | cat -e
$
1 -1$

the order of lines is not important but order of elements in a subset is.

you must not have any duplicates(eg: '1 2' and '2 1')

for example for the command $> ./power_set1 5 1 2 3 4 5
this is valid :
1 4
2 3
5
this is also valid :
2 3
5
1 4
but not this one
4 1
3 2
5
